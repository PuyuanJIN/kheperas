    The probability of delivery failure modulu is coded. The noise spectral power density formula can be looked into more deeply.

    package robot_localization is pulled from github however there is missing dependency for cmake the package, the launch file has the robot now.

    there is a controller yaml file made to replace the gazebo hardcoded diff_drive in order to rule out the reason why the robot has a random swift. The problem has finally been pinned to the urdf file which is the geometry of the robot. The swift happens due to there is not enough contact file for the robot to be dynamic stable and it is finally been solved. the gazebo simulation is now stable.

    Adding friction property to the two driving wheels does not solve the rotation problem in the gazebo simulation.

    I have created a gazebo environment for the robot to run in. But on the terminal the spawn service randomly fail, i have no idea why. But from the view of gazebo, everything initiated nicely. this failure does not happen everytime. this might be some error in the launch file or the kheperas.urdf.

    i have tried again to use xacro to format the kheperas urdf but it does not work again, i have no idea why. SO i move back to the standard urdf format to code it in the original way. The robot spawn in the gazebo nicely but it has a werid moving which is not desired.

    the kheperas base xacro files and its launch file has been coded, however there is some problem with the macro kheperas which need to be solved.

    created urdf and xacro folder in urdf and launch folder in order to distinguish what is the different robot config file and it's according launch file.

    Added inertial property such as mass, inertia to the kheperas. The rviz gives a warning about the base link does not support an inertia value. This need to be deal with if futhure problems come across. Other than this, the inertial properties loaded corrected.
